abstract = {Demand for aluminum in final products has increased 30-fold since 1950 to 45 million tonnes per year, with forecasts predicting this exceptional growth to continue so that demand will reach 2–3 times today’s levels by 2050. Aluminum production uses 3.5% of global electricity and causes 1% of global CO2 emissions, while meeting a 50% cut in emissions by 2050 against growing demand would require at least a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions per tonne of aluminum produceda challenging prospect. In this paper we trace the global flows of aluminum from liquid metal to final products, revealing for the first time a complete map of the aluminum system and providing a basis for future study of the emissions abatement potential of material efficiency. The resulting Sankey diagram also draws attention to two key issues. First, around half of all liquid aluminum (∼39 Mt) produced each year never reaches a final product, and a detailed discussion of these high yield losses shows significant opportunities for improvement. Second, aluminum recycling, which avoids the high energy costs and emissions of electrolysis, requires signification “dilution” (∼ 8 Mt) and “cascade” (∼ 6 Mt) flows of higher aluminum grades to make up for the shortfall in scrap supply and to obtain the desired alloy mix, increasing the energy required for recycling.},

abstract = {The construction of new domestic properties contributes 2% of UK territorial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The UK government aims to increase construction of new homes in England by almost a third, to 300,000 per year by the mid-2020s, whilst simultaneously reducing emissions in line with its net zero 2050 commitment. In this paper, for the first time, the upfront embodied carbon cost of constructing domestic properties in the UK by 2050 is quantified. A bottom-up analysis modelling seven domestic building typologies was used, with the material use for each based on current UK practice. Possible interventions to reduce the embodied carbon cost are then analysed. The results show that maintaining today’s levels of construction will use the remaining 2050 carbon budget apportioned to house building (160 MtCO2e) by 2036, and cause a substantial increase in domestic floor area per capita. However, construction could reduce and cease entirely by 2035 without reducing today’s living floor area per capita (37.5 m2), resulting in a substantially reduced cumulative embodied carbon of 88 MtCO2e by 2050. Increasing living floor area per capita to the EU average of 40.5 m2, can be achieved within the carbon budget and with zero emissions by 2050. In contrast, increasing house building to government targets will result in double the cumulative emissions than the budget allows.
A number of carbon reduction interventions were then investigated. It was found that of to 75% embodied carbon savings can be achieved by simultaneously changing the typology share, increasing material efficiency, increasing conversion from non-residential buildings and increasing the use of timber for structural purposes.

These impacts can be ameliorated to some extent by the ongoing pursuit of efficiencies within existing processes, but demand is anticipated to double in the next 40 years, and this will lead to an unacceptable increase in overall impacts unless the total requirement for material production and processing is reduced. This is the goal of material efficiency, and this paper aims to stimulate interest in the area. Four major strategies for reducing material demand through material efficiency are discussed: longer-lasting products; modularisation and remanufacturing; component re-use; designing products with less material. In industrialised nations, these strategies have had little attention, because of economic, regulatory and social barriers, which are each examined. However, evidence from waste management and the pursuit of energy efficiency suggests that these barriers might be overcome, and an outline of potential mechanisms for change is given. In bringing together insights into material efficiency from a wide range of disciplines, the paper presents a set of 20 open questions for future work.}

It produces large volumes of waste both in production and at end-of-life disposal. More efficient use of materials could play a key role in achieving multiple environmental and economic benefits. Material efficiency entails the pursuit of technical strategies, business models, consumer preferences, and policy instruments that would lead to a substantial reduction in the production of new materials required to deliver well-being. Although many opportunities exist, material efficiency is not realized in practice to its full potential. We evaluate the potential for material efficiency improvement, highlight the drivers to realize material efficiency, and anticipate ways forward to realize the potential of dematerializing our lives and the economy to limit the impacts of climate change and remain on a sustainable development path. }

A comprehensive understanding of how resources are utilized is required to support a circular bioeconomy. This article presents the first systematic assessment of forest biomass flows and stocks in Portugal and analyzes circularity and resource efficiency through a comprehensive set of indicators, while providing recommendations for their use and improvement in different contexts. A Material Flow Analysis was developed for 2015, including paper, wood panels, furniture, carpentry, packaging, other woodwork, and energy (firewood, pellets, charcoal, electricity, heat), addressing uncertainty. Material flow analysis indicators (e.g., domestic material consumption) and circularity/resource efficiency indicators (cascade factor, material circularity indicator, recycled input, recovery rate) were assessed. In 2015, 49% of forest biomass was used for energy and 51% for material production. The wood sector in Portugal is heterogeneous regarding circularity. Paper and wood packaging were the most recycled products (highest material circularity indicator: 0.49 and recovery rate: 54%), while the panels sector used the most industrial residues (highest cascade factor: 3.78). The indicators analyzed provided a complementary assessment of circularity, giving both system wide (cascade factor) and sector- (cascade factor, recycled input rate, recovery rate) or product-based (material circularity indicator) views. Cascade factor permits an analysis of the whole system and of separate sectors, and an assessment of post-consumer and industrial residues, and both material and energy use. Material circularity indicator considers closed- and open-loop recycling of post-consumer residues, being complementary to the cascade factor. Indicators providing complementary perspectives are important to capture multiple types of resource use and valorization within the bioeconomy system.},

abstract = {Cascading, the use of the same unit of a resource in multiple successional applications, is considered as a viable means to improve the efficiency of resource utilization and to decrease environmental impacts. Wood, as a regrowing but nevertheless limited and increasingly in demand resource, can be used in cascades, thereby increasing the potential efficiency per unit of wood. This study aims to assess the influence of cascading wood utilization on optimizing the overall environmental impact of wood utilization. By combining a material flow model of existing wood applications – both for materials provision and energy production – with an algebraic optimization tool, the effects of the use of wood in cascades can be modelled and quantified based on life cycle impact assessment results for all production processes. To identify the most efficient wood allocation, the effects of a potential substitution of non-wood products were taken into account in a part of the model runs. The considered environmental indicators were global warming potential, particulate matter formation, land occupation and an aggregated single score indicator. We found that optimizing either the overall global warming potential or the value of the single score indicator of the system leads to a simultaneous relative decrease of all other considered environmental impacts. The relative differences between the impacts of the model run with and without the possibility of a cascading use of wood were 7% for global warming potential and the single score indicator, despite cascading only influencing a small part of the overall system, namely wood panel production. Cascading led to savings of up to 14% of the annual primary wood supply of the study area. We conclude that cascading can improve the overall performance of a wood utilization system.

abstract = {Summary
In this study, we used material flow analysis and life cycle assessment to quantify the environmental impacts and impact reductions related to wood consumption in Japan from 1970 to 2013. We then conducted future projections of the impacts and reductions until 2050 based on multiple future scenarios of domestic forestry, wood, and energy use. An impact assessment method involving characterization, damage assessment, and integration with a monetary unit was used, and the results were expressed in Japanese yen (JPY). We found that environmental impacts from paper consumption, such as climate change and urban air pollution, were significant and accounted for 56% to 83% of the total environmental impacts between 1970 and 2013. Therefore, reductions of greenhouse gas, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide emissions from paper production would be an effective measure to reduce the overall environmental impacts. An increase in wood use for building construction, civil engineering, furniture materials, and energy production could lead to reductions of environmental impacts (via carbon storage, material substitution, and fuel substitution) amounting to 357 billion JPY in 2050, which is equivalent to 168% of the 2013 levels. Particularly, substitution of nonwooden materials, such as cement, concrete, and steel, with wood products in building construction could significantly contribute to impact reductions. Although an increase of wood consumption could reduce environmental impacts, such as climate change, resource consumption, and urban air pollution, increased wood consumption would also be associated with land‐use impacts. Therefore, minimizing land transformations from forest to barren land will be important.},

abstract = {Summary
Material flow analysis (MFA) is widely used to investigate flows and stocks of resources or pollutants in a defined system. Data availability to quantify material flows on a national or global level is often limited owing to data scarcity or lacking data. MFA input data are therefore considered inherently uncertain. In this work, an approach to characterize the uncertainty of MFA input data is presented and applied to a case study on plastics flows in major Austrian consumption sectors in the year 2010. The developed approach consists of data quality assessment as a basis for estimating the uncertainty of input data. Four different implementations of the approach with respect to the translation of indicator scores to uncertainty ranges (linear‐ vs. exponential‐type functions) and underlying probability distributions (normal vs. log‐normal) are examined. The case study results indicate that the way of deriving uncertainty estimates for material flows has a stronger effect on the uncertainty ranges of the resulting plastics flows than the assumptions about the underlying probability distributions. Because these uncertainty estimates originate from data quality evaluation as well as uncertainty characterization, it is crucial to use a well‐defined approach, building on several steps to ensure the consistent translation of the data quality underlying material flow calculations into their associated uncertainties. Although subjectivity is inherent in uncertainty assessment in MFA, the proposed approach is consistent and provides a comprehensive documentation of the choices underlying the uncertainty analysis, which is essential to interpret the results and use MFA as a decision support tool.},

This translates into net exports of raw wood and imports of transformed products, detrimental to both the trade balance and the local creation of wealth. At the same time, no consistent and homogeneous accounts for wood product production and consumption exist at this time. This article first aims at objectifying this situation by undertaking the first material flow analysis of the French forest-wood supply chain. We then evaluate the potential consequences of various scenarios of raw wood exports reduction policies, namely subsidies for consumption or transformation and taxation of exports, on both economic outcomes for the different actors and material flows. We thus provide an example of coupling material flow analysis with economic modeling in an attempt to move from the diagnostic phase to the assessment of possible actions within a decision-making perspective.

The demolition sector generates a large amount of timber waste that could be directly reused or recycled in other products for structural purposes. Timber should be graded before it is used for structural purposes, and visual strength grading standards designed for new timber do not properly grade recovered timber. Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) is now one of the most common wood products used in construction. CLT would therefore be a good option for recycling timber due to the high quantity of material used in CLT manufacturing. This paper investigates the possibilities of using recovered timber from demolition to manufacture CLT. Twelve CLT panels from recovered and new timber were manufactured and tested. The static modulus of elasticity was found to be the same between recovered and new timber, while the bending strength of CLT from recovered timber was lower than it was for CLT from new timber. Non-destructive testing for the estimation of mechanical properties of boards and CLT panels was successfully developed.},

The method is applicable for manifold research topics. This is shown in three examples. The wood flow analysis represents a total resource assessment including all wood products in all process steps from forest to disposal.

abstract = {In 2018, the construction sector was responsible for 39% of the worldwide energy and process-related carbon dioxide emissions (Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction et al., 2019). This is partly due to the embodied carbon, which represents the carbon emissions related to building construction and material production (LETI, 2020). While zero energy buildings and zero energy renovations start to get the operational carbon down, the circular economy aims to do this by closing material loops and stimulating the reuse of discarded materials in building construction (Ellen McArthur Foundation et al., 2015). Although it is not a new phenomenon, material reuse does require a substantially different approach and is at this point not yet common in the building industry. This is especially true for load-bearing components. This article presents a pilot project for the reuse of discarded timber formwork for the construction of the façade and (load-bearing) substructure of a new house. Through this pilot case and by reflecting on a series of similar cases, it studies the remaining challenges for material reuse but also proposes and assesses redesign strategies that will allow upscaling the reuse of timber formwork. The project shows that although waste, material, and money can be saved by using reclaimed materials, it does complicate the design and construction process and, as such, does not necessarily reduce the total project budget. Moreover, for reuse to become a current practice, new design approaches and collaborations will need to be established. Finally, socio-economic factors must be considered to increase the acceptance of reclaimed materials in new building construction.},

This study assesses the environmentally optimal wood utilisation patterns under varying wood cascading options, using the example of Switzerland. Cascading is the use of the same wood unit in multiple, successive product cycles. To consider aspects relevant at the system level (e.g. stocks/flows, demand/supply constraints) as well as at the product level (e.g. process inventories), we present a model that combines material flow analysis (MFA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and mathematical optimisation to identify environmentally optimal wood use scenarios concerning climate change and particulate matter formation. We separately include the temporal dynamics of biogenic carbon flows, i.e. carbon uptake, storage and subsequent release, which may have a considerable influence on the climate change performance of wood products.
Results indicate that multiple cascading (mC) of wood can decrease environmental impacts: total systemic impact reductions over the modelled 200-year time horizon compared to single cascading (i.e. all waste wood is directly incinerated), are between 35–59 Mt CO2-eq. and 43–63 kt PM10-eq. Driving factors for the environmental impact of future wood use scenarios are: waste wood processing efficiency, wood storage effects (in case of biogenic carbon accounting), and available cascading options. Particularly, high quality wood cascade of wooden beams is a promising recycling path for reducing environmental impacts.
We conclude that by implementing wood cascading, future Swiss wood utilisation can be further improved in terms of environmental impact. The tool combination of dynamic MFA, LCA and optimisation proved to be suitable to identify environmentally optimal scenarios for a complex value chain.},

Contemporary construction of tall buildings from timber, in whole or in part, suggests a growing interest in the potential for building with wood at a scale not previously attainable. As wood is the only significant building material that is grown, we have a natural inclination that building in wood is good for the environment. But under what conditions is this really the case? The environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product, a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it. Much of this can come from the biomass of the tree itself, but that requires investment in plant, which is not always possible in an industry that is widely distributed among many small producers. And what should we build with wood? Are skyscrapers in timber a good use of this natural resource, or are there other aspects of civil and structural engineering, or large-scale infrastructure, that would be a better use of wood? Here, we consider a holistic picture ranging in scale from the science of the cell wall to the engineering and global policies that could maximise forestry and timber construction as a boon to both people and the planet.},

equivalent (CO

) as greenhouse gases in 2008. United Kingdom (UK) policy is to decrease these emissions to 154 Mt by 2050. This paper investigates the role that wood construction products and wood-based panels may play in mitigating these greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we have concentrated on production and consumption in 2005: all solid wood products and wood based panels consumed in the UK in 2005 contained almost 16 Mt CO
2e
. Using established international methodologies and the 'stock change approach' to carbon storage, the net increase in CO
2e
stored in all UK wood products in 2005 was calculated to be 7·1 Mt CO
2e
. Applying the newer UNFCCC 'production approach' gave a net increase in CO
2e
stored in wood based panels and solid wood of 3·4 Mt CO
2e
in 2005, approximately half of this storage was in wood based panels.
The focus of previous UK studies of carbon in construction has been new housing. We estimate that only 10% of CO
2e
contained in all UK solid wood and wood based panel products consumed went into new housing in 2005. We have modelled the storage of CO
2e
in solid wood and wood based panels for other construction sectors and used this to model changes in construction methods: if current trends in UK housing construction methods continue and are extended to other construction sectors, there is the potential to increase the annual increment of CO
2e
stored in wood products in construction from 9 Mt CO
2e
to 14 Mt CO

The existing building stock represents a huge accumulation of physical resources: a material ‘reserve’ that could be mined in the future to improve resource efficiency. However, in the absence of systematically collected information about materials deposited in the built environment, the ability to manage and exploit them is limited. An approach to quantification of material stocks based on the use of secondary data from external research bodies, national statistics and a housing stock management database is used to estimate the timber stock in residential buildings constructed in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets before 1992. Results show a total timber accumulation of almost 67,000tonnes across 68,000 dwellings, with a material intensity for timber between 20−34kg/m2 of building floorspace (6.8–11.2kg/m3 of gross building volume) for terraced houses and 5.4−11kg/m2 (1.8–3.6kg/m3) for flats and maisonettes. Generally, there is more timber in floors and roofs, and in older buildings. This method appears to be robust, as it results in comparable timber intensities to those determined using other methods in previous studies. It can be used for other materials and may be useful in other contexts where data is available (i.e., other scales, building types and materials), and capable of contributing to the growing understand of existing buildings as material banks.},

The greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of three forest-based bioenergy systems from the USA, Canada and Spain supplying wood pellets for electricity in the UK were evaluated by conducting lifecycle assessments and forest carbon modelling of the three forest systems. Cumulative emissions were analysed by calculating the forest carbon stock change and net GHG emissions balance of the forest-based bioenergy electricity. The analysis considered both the replacement of the existing electricity mix with bioenergy electricity and forest management with and without bioenergy use. The supply chain emissions and forest carbon balances indicated that GHG emission reductions are possible. However, the cumulative net GHG balance at forest landscape scale revealed that the reduction potential is limited, potentially with no GHG reductions in fast growing forests with shorter rotations, while slow growing forest systems with longer rotations result in greater GHG reductions. This means that the maximum climate benefit is delivered at a different point in time for different forest systems. To evaluate the climate change mitigation potential of forest-based bioenergy it is therefore necessary to consider the management, utilisation and relevant counterfactual of the whole forest and its products. In terms of climate change mitigation potential and minimising possible negative impacts that would require multi-level governance.

abstract = {•Detailed material flow analysis of cement going from raw materials to end use.•Assessment of the impact of five material efficiency techniques which together have the potential to abate CO2 in construction be 52%.•Detailed methodological framework for the creation of cement material flows.
Cement manufacture is responsible for 5–7% of world CO2 emissions. Cement is primarily used in concrete, the most used material on the planet and a critical part of any analysis of emissions reduction strategy. To estimate the potential for reducing demand, this work analyses material flow in the cement industry, using the UK in 2014 as a case study. Combining published data, analytic assumptions, and interviews we estimated the material flow of cement from the production to a breakdown of its use in applications. Having broken down the demand for cement into 25 applications, multiple material efficiency techniques were considered: substituting cement for calcined clay and limestone, reducing the cement content of concrete, post-tensioning floor slabs, using more precast building elements, reducing construction waste, and reducing the overdesign in construction. We produce a final estimate of the total reduction in emissions achievable from material efficiency: 51.3%. Due to overlap and interactions between the methods, the attribution of the carbon abatement depends on the sequence of application. In this analysis, we have applied the reduction of overdesign last, because it is independent of the others, and would require a cultural change. We show then that cement demand from floors, repairs and maintenance, concrete beams, and applications within the transport sector should be targeted. The substitution of cement with calcined clay and limestone has the biggest potential to reduce cement demand (27%) and carbon emissions in the UK. Reducing the amount of cement in concrete has the next highest potential (10%), followed by post-tensioning floor slabs (3%).},

The transition of our economy towards a bioeconomy is likely to increase the demand for wood in the future. Because the roundwood supply is limited, wood cascading is a promising concept for meeting the growing demand. In this context, it is necessary to map the current timber market for analyzing potential options for the cascading of recovered timber, and for quantifying future amounts of recovered timber, differentiated by the type of semi-finished wood product and sectoral origin. Therefore, a material flow analysis (MFA) for Germany during 2019 is performed and a model for the prediction of the recovery of timber volumes (PRecTimber) is developed. This model is based on a distributed decay approach which considers sectoral lifetimes. Historical data for the domestic consumption of timber products are used to calculate the annual decay of various timber products entering consumption. The MFA results in about 62 Mm3 solid wood equivalents (SWE) of various wood raw material assortments being required in the domestic production of wood products. An increasing amount of recovered timber with a minimum of 26.6 Mm3 (13.1 Mt) for 2019 to 29.5 Mm3 (14.2 Mt) in 2050 can be expected. In 2050, the recovered timber is derived from the sectors construction with 52%, furniture with 30%, packaging with 15%, and others with 2% (mainly consisting of sawn wood and particleboard products). The results of the model can be used, to derive estimates of the dimension and quality of the future recovered timber accompanying the potentials for cascading.},

abstract = {Summary
Despite major improvements in recycling over the last decades, the pulp and paper sector is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental pressures. Further reduction of virgin material requirements and environmental impacts requires a detailed understanding of the global material flows in paper production and consumption. This study constructs a Sankey diagram of global material flows in the paper life cycle, from primary inputs to end‐of‐life waste treatment, based on a review of publicly available data. It then analyzes potential improvements in material flows and discusses recycling and material efficiency metrics. The article argues that the use of the collection rate as a recycling metric does not directly stimulate avoidance of virgin inputs and associated impacts. An alternative metric compares paper for recycling (recovered paper) with total fibrous inputs and indicates that the current rate is at just over half of the technical potential. Material efficiency metrics are found to be more useful if they relate to the reuse potential of wastes. The material balance developed in this research provides a solid basis for further study of global sustainable production and consumption of paper. The conclusions on recycling and efficiency should be considered for improving environmental assessment and stimulating a shift toward resource efficiency and the circular economy.},

Producing this glass is energy intensive and contributes annual CO2 emissions of some 86Mt. An accurate map of the global glass supply chain is needed to help identify emissions mitigation options from across the supply chain, including process energy efficiency and material efficiency options. This map does not yet exist, so we address this knowledge gap by tracing the production chain from raw materials to end of life and producing a global Sankey diagram of container and flat glass making for 2014. To understand future demand for flat glass we also model the stocks of glass in vehicles and buildings. The analysis shows the relative scale of glass flows and stocks worldwide and provides a baseline for future study of the emission mitigation potential of energy and material efficiency of manufacturing with glass.},

abstract = {This paper provides a novel insight into using reversible mass timber connectors in light-timber framed (LTF) construction to create dismountable, panelised LTF construction systems that enable adaptable building design and panel reuse in the context of a circular economy. The study presented in this paper focused on Australian LTF panelised construction:. A total of 10 IdeFix 304 connectors by SIHGA GmbH, and 20 M20 connectors by SHERPA Connection Systems GmbH were installed in Australian machine graded pine and subjected to monotonic tensile and shear loads to assess their feasibility in the given application. Two strength prediction models were evaluated in comparison to experimental results: Formulae given in the manufacturers’ European Technical Assessments (ETAs) and a prediction model adapted from literature. On average, the latter was more accurate in the given configuration. Considering the set goal of repeated assembly and disassembly, the connectors with a tight fit faced tolerance issues due to moisture fluctuations. Furthermore, rupture of the connector was observed in some instances, owed to higher screw withdrawal capacity in Australian timber. A reduction of the number of screws or their length is suggested to achieve a more ductile response with screw withdrawal. Finally, following comparative analysis of experimental tests and prediction models, recommendations were made for future design of novel LTF panel connectors in the context of disassembly and reuse.
•Two proprietary European connectors developed for mass timber construction were tested in Australia machine graded pine.•A new modified prediction model for estimating the strength of the steel-timber connection was developed.•The potential responses for compound angle screws were theoretically analysed.•Timber connector design recommendations were made to allow for panel disassembly and reuse.},

abstract = {Orthogonal structural timber framing is the predominant method for building low density residential buildings in a large proportion of developed countries. Today this framing system is highly refined to be economically advantageous—making use of low-value and widely available materials. However, this construction product largely ignores the emerging ‘Circular Economy’ (CE) sustainability agenda. At the end of a buildings life, and when deconstruction is attempted, most materials integrated into an orthogonal frame are irreversibly damaged. Furthermore, deconstruction is time consuming and yields very few valuable materials. Thus, this research questions the suitability of conventional framing methods to achieve true life-cycle sustainability and suggests a series of radical non-orthogonal solutions in response. These solutions are centered around maximizing the recovery of all materials attached to (and located in) the structural frame at the end of a buildings life. Non-orthogonal frames are the superior solution as they are generally inherently resistant to lateral loads and can be dynamically modulated to fit within many different building conditions. The research uses computer-aided fabrication technology to integrate jointing and assembly conditions in the non-orthogonal timber frame geometry that substantially speeds up end-of-life deconstruction.},

The wood processing industry also aims at a more intensive resource recovery and usable residual volumes. Important volumes of wood processing residue potentials can be found at the EU level. However, to date no reliable calculation approach has been established. To fill the information gap, this study presents an approach for calculating the supply of wood processing residues. The methodological approach follows the concept of a material flow analysis. We quantify the material flows based on product-specific conversion factors and the coefficients of material efficiency. This paper intends to develop a calculation approach based on existing statistical data from official classifications such as Prodcom. We perform the calculation approach on standardised wood packaging products at the European level. The calculated supply of wood processing residues the European Union in 2018 was 29.7 million m³f with a total material input of about 70.8 million m³f and a production volume of 40.8 million m³f. A maximum volume of 29.6 million m³f sawnwood is used for the production of wooden containers. Quantification results can be further differentiated – e.g., the share of sawmill by-products. Hence, the calculation approach supports the visualisation and understanding of material flows within the forest-based sector. Wood processing residue coefficients resulting from product specific MFA can be repeatedly applied to annual production data of wood products, wood composites and wood supply chains. Thus, the quantification of wood processing residues improves the results of existing and future wood resource balances including cascade uses by increasing their level of detail.}
