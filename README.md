# UK wood end use flows

This repository is linked to the project "Robust modelling of material flows to end-uses under uncertainty: UK wood flows and material efficiency opportunities." which:
- provides a material flow map of wood for the UK in 2019 all the way to end-uses
- introduces a systematic method to handle mixed units during the reconciliation of material flows and uncertainty in data observations, conversion factors and process recipes.
## Contents

Data that are graphically represented in Figure 3 of the manuscript are stored in the "data_for_violin_plot_uncertainty_Figure_3_manuscript" and "data_from_sankey_figure_3_manuscript" folders.
- The excel file "data_from_sankey_figure_3_manuscript" contains the data that was used to draw the sankey diagram in Figure 3.
- The excel file "data_box_plot_Figure_3" contains the data which was used to plot the violin plots in Figure 3.

## Structure

1. process recipes are described in the system-definitions/structure.md file. 
2. data observations are stored in the data/flows.csv file
3. conversion factors and their uncertainty characterisation and the uncertainty characterisation of recipe mixes are stored in data/uncertainty.py file 


## Installation

Using `conda`: run `conda env create` to create an environment called `UK-wood-end-use-flows` with the required packages (listed in `environment.yml`)

Activate this environment with `conda activate UK-wood-end-use-flows` before running the commands below.

## Building documentation pages

Run `doit`. Tasks that need to run RDFox need an extra argument `script_source_dir` to the Ontologies folder, for example:

```
doit run enhance_data script_source_dir=<...>
```
